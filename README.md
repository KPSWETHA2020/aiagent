# Developing AI Agent with PEAS Description

## AIM

To find the PEAS description for the given AI problem and develop an AI agent.

## THEORY
A vacuum-cleaner world with just two locations.
Each location can be clean or dirty.
The agent can move left or right and can clean the square that it occupies

## PEAS DESCRIPTION
| Agent Type  | Performance Measure | Environment  | Actuators | Sensors |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Vaccum-Cleaner  | Cleanliness, Number of Movements  | Rooms  | Wheels, suction tool  | Location, Cleanliness |


## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1:
The inputs are location of the agent and the status of the location.

### STEP 2:
The output of the system is Right Left and Suck.

### STEP 3:
Agent Type:Vaccum Cleaner Performance Measure: Cleanliness , Number of Movements Environment: Rooms Actuators: Wheels and Suction tool Sensor: Location Sensor and Cleanliness sensor
### STEP 4:
The agent should detect the location and suck if the location it is dirty,else it should move to the next location

### STEP 5:
The performance is measured with the number of movements and the cleaning action of the agent.
